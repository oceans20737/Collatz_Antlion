Description:
Viewed from the outside, the Collatz Conjecture traces elegant, exponentially expanding curves 
reminiscent of a "Morning Glory." However, by dissecting its internal structure within Binary 
Logarithmic Space (log2), one discovers a ruthless "Antlion's Pit" that drags all numerical 
values toward the central point "1."

This program is a simulation engine designed to visually prove the duality of this mathematical 
beauty and gravitational inevitability.

Core Theory:
- The 2^n Tower (Central Axis): Defines all powers of 2 as the backbone and the primary source 
  of vertical gravity.
- Binary Logarithmic Mapping: Compresses the infinite numerical universe into a 180-degree 
  polar space, redefining magnitude as "depth in the Pit."
- Structural Inequality: Contrasts the weak "ascents" of 3x+1 with the dominant "falls" of n/2, 
  illustrating the necessity of convergence.

------------------------------------------------------------

Key Features:
- Visual Synthesis: Maps the elegant geometry of the "Morning Glory" onto the terrifying logic 
  of the "Antlion's Pit."
- Convergence Slides: Reveals how series like 5 * 2^n align along specific angles, forming 
  direct slides to the center.
- Interactive Exploration: Allows users to trace the dramatic surrender of any integer into 
  the Pit.
